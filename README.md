# Shoppable Video Application Prototype

A shoppable video application UI built with Bootstrap and AngularJS.

Instructions

* Install Sass

(http://sass-lang.com/install)


In your open terminal window type:

> gem install sass

This will install Sass and any dependencies for you.
If you get an error message then it's likely you will need to use the sudo
command to install the Sass gem.

> sudo gem install sass

Double-check. You should now have Sass installed, but it never hurts to
double-check. In your terminal application you can type:

> sass -v

It should return Sass 3.4.22 (Selective Steve). Congratulations!
You've successfully installed Sass.


* Install gulp globally.

> pm install --global gulp
